## cpu-yolo-objectdetection

# Download official pretrained weights
  https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolov3.weights
and keep it in the same folder as jupyter notebook

# This notebook is simple implementation object detection using Yolo weights trained on coco dataset
# Weights were used by using OpenCV
# Inside the algorithm for object detection, face regnition algorithm was implemented
# For loading Authorized Person's image in the database use dimension (96,96,3)
# It can be changed but with change in FRmodel's input dimension
